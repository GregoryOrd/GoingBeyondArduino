See this wikipedia page on Pulse Width Modulation:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation

The idea is that we can use pulse width modulation to increase and decrease the duty 
cycle of the signal. That is, the width, of the on portion of the square wave.
A super simplitic way to think about it is that increasing this duty cycle
increases the average power. So we can use this to control things such as dimming
an LED over time by reducing the average power being seen by that LED.

Control through PWM could also be used to control motors, for example where we have 
a similar, increasing or decreasing power/intensity over time.

We can use PWM as a digital to analog converter.
